# Math 235 - Lab 1

This is the first Computer Lab for Math 235.  In this course, we will use the software [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) to perform calculations.  SageMath is based on the popular programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/).  It is free and open-source.

To get started, proceed with the following steps (or watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_aQoJy1yF4)):

1.  Open a new tab and log into your [GitHub](https://github.com) account.  (If you don't have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, you have to sign up.)
2.  Once you are in your GitHub account, click on your `identicon` (or the picture of yourself if you already uploaded one) at the top right corner.  Then, click on `Settings`.
3.  In the left menu, click on `Codespaces`.
4.  Scroll down and in the section **Editor Preference**, choose `JupyterLab`
5.  Click on the following button:

6.  Click on the green button `Create codespace`.
7.  If you click on `View logs`, you will see that a bunch of things is happening.  You don't need to understand any of that, but it will take about **10 minutes** for the codespace to initialize.  Let it be.  Let it do its thing.  Be patient. 
8.  Once the process is done, a new tab in your browser should open and you should see the JupyterLab editor.
9.  On the left, click on the folder `lab`, and then on the notebook `lab1.ipynb`.
10.  At the top right corner, click on `Python 3 (ipykernel)`, and then select `SageMath 9.2` instead.
11.  Go ahead and work on the notebook following the instructions. 
12.  If you want, you can save your notebook, and close the window.  You can then come back to it later to complete the assignment.  In order to do so, click on your `identicon`, then on `Codespaces`.  You should see a codespace `danielvallieres/math235-lab1`.  Click on `...`, then click on `Open in`, and choose `Open in JupyterLab`.  Your notebook should reopen in the state you left it earlier. 

Once you are done, go over the following steps to submit your Computer Lab (or watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTf3_zoYprQ)).

1.  Save your notebook.
2.  Click on `file`, then `Save and Export Notebook as...` and choose `HTML`.
3.  Open the .html file.
4.  Then convert to a pdf file.  You can do this by printing the html file and then exporting as a pdf file.
5.  Print your pdf file and submit it in class before on the day it is due.
